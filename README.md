# Contact Form

A responsive contact form built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project includes real-time form validation, success feedback, and smooth user interaction.

## Features

- Real-time validation for all input fields (Name, Email, Subject, Message)
- Displays success message upon successful form submission
- Highlights errors and success states visually
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop screens
- Clean, modern layout with subtle animations

## How It Works

- **HTML**: Structure of the form and input fields
- **CSS**: Styling, focus effects, responsive layout, error/success states
- **JavaScript**: Form validation, error handling, success message, button loading animation

### Validation Logic

- Email must be in a valid format
- Error messages appear under the respective input field
- Success message appears after simulated submission (1.2s delay)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Novera669/contact-form.git
2. Open index.html in your browser.
